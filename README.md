# Advent_of_Code25
My solutions for the Advent of Code of the year 2025

INTRO:

Hello, World!
In here, I'm trying to solve the Advent of Code tasks and show my working steps.

Each task has its own working folder with mostly just a main.py file.
As you might think now, I mainly work in Python for this.

For me, maybe coming back later on and solving some tasks again in a different language, I created a main folder with the programming language name as the title.
